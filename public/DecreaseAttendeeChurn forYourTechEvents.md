Hackathons... product launches... meetups... they all suffer high churn rates (often >50%).

How to decrease churn? 
Increase touch points with attendees before the event. For most events, this looks like sending emails & potentially texts through Lu.ma to attendees.

Each touch point should require minimal effort but should be a vote in terms of the user committing to the event. Here are some examples of touch points you can have with attendees before your event to get them invested:

1. "Reserve your T-Shirt (size needed)"  - if attendees know you're setting aside a t-shirt specifically for them, they're more likely to show up because they see you're investing in them and they wouldn't want it to go to waste.
2. "Preorder your Lunch (Burritos)" - this is a variant of the "reserve your t-shirt" email. It works for the same reasons, but also helps make sure you don't order more food than you need and that you order the right amount of each item.
3. "Join The Event Discord & find a team" - once the attendee of your event has started interacting with other attendees, they start to feel even more committed to the event
4. "Here's a buddy pass, invite a friend?" - giving attendees the opportunity to invite their friends & increases the likelihood that they'll show up & it also means their friend might too.
5. "Confirm attendance & event location" - the night before the event, if you require attendees to confirm they're attending the event and remind them of the location of the event, they'll be more likely to make a point of orienting their schedule around it

The more touch points you have with attendees, the more will actually show up to your event. The more you show that you're invested in them, the more they'll think about you and give you their valuable time by showing up to your event.
